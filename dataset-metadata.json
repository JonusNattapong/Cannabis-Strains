Each row captures base product metadata (name, breeder, GBP prices, pack options, product/image URLs) plus detail-page narrative sections (overview, growth_and_harvest, experience), taxonomy tags (seed_type, flowering_period_type, indica_sativa, type_ratio, strain_type_summary), descriptive attributes (environment, strength, medical_strains, smell_taste, effect, climate, flavor), grow metrics (thc, cbd, yield_indoor/outdoor, height_indoor/outdoor, indoor_height_detail, indoor_flowering_time, outdoor_harvest_time, flowering_time, harvest_month, genetic_background), and merchandising indicators (stock_availability, sale_item, most_popular_seeds).\n\nScraping is performed with `scrape_seed_city.py`, which handles pagination, polite delays, and Cloudflare bypass via cloudscraper. Missing values simply reflect attributes the source page did not publish. Ideal use cases include market analysis, cultivar comparison, and cultivation planning benchmarks.",
