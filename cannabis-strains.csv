The journey to recreate this strain involved setbacks, including the loss of the original Cheese clone, initially sourced through Zorro of Red Eye Magazine. Subsequent versions, though not identical, maintained remarkable quality. The breeding process for feminized seeds of this strain is notably difficult, involving a third-generation Cheese backcross selected from Big Buddha's seeds to ensure the potency and distinct old-school Cheese funk.
